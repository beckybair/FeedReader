## Instructions
_Run this on your device_
You can either clone or download the zip file.  Once on your computer, navigate to the location you saved it.  Open the folder and double click the index.html file.  This will open the feed app locally in your browser. You will see the default feed list of items. If you scroll down to the bottom, you will find the Jasmine tests that were run and if they passed or not. 

To edit the tests, navigate to the directory of the downloaded folder in your terminal window.  Make sure this is the folder where the package.json file is located.  In there type the following to install all the listed dependencies in the package.json file:  **npm install**

Now open the downloaded folder in your text editor of choice and navigate to the "jasmine" folder. Inside that folder is another folder called "spec", open it.  There you should see the file:  feedreader.js.  Open it and edit the tests you want to edit.  When done, save it and refresh your browser to see the tests. 

_Side note_
Currently the gulp processes do not need to be run and are not here to run the test.  They are there as practice and to be tied in at a later date.
